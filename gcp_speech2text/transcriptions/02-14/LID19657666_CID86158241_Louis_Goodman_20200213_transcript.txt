confirming your name is Lewis Goodman L ohh uis okay and in addition to confirming your name I need a record that I've provided you with these disclosures and I need for you to sign it but instead of having to physically sign something we can actually have you sign over the phone right now by recording this conversation is that alright and we'll have a great so just to let you know our service is free to you because we are paid a referral fee by our partner communities only if we help you find a good fit and you decide to move in that referral fee that the communities paid to us ranges from 78% to 120% of the first month's rent depending upon the agreement but no one can ever charge you more because you've used our services so you would never see any additional fees or increase to rent rates anything like that related to working with A Place for Mom so do you understand that our services are free to you 
yes I do understand that
