first let me go ahead and confirm your name is Aaron Brown is that correct yes or no okay so in addition to confirming your name I need a record that I provided you with these disclosures and I need for you to sign it but instead of having to physically sign something we can actually have you sign over the phone right now by recording this conversation is that all right fucker yeah okay so just to let you know our service is free to you because we're paid a referral fee by our partner communities only we help you find a good fit and you decide to move your mom in that referral see that the communities page which ranges from 78% to 120% of the first month's rent deposit agreement but no one can ever do it tomorrow because you've used our services so you would never see any additional fees or increase rent or anything like that so do you understand that our services are free to you 
yes ma'am
