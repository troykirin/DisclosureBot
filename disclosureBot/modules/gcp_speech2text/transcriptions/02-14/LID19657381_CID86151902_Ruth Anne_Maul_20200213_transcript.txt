confirm your name is Kristie Grace is that correct that's correct yeah okay so in addition to confirming your name I need a record that I have provided you with these disclosures and I need for you to sign it but instead of physically signing something we can actually have you sign over the phone right now I just by recording this conversation is that alright okay that's okay so just to let you know our service is free to you because we are paid a referral fee by our partner communities only as we hope you find a good fit and you decide to move your mom in that referral fee that the communities paid to us ranges from 78% to 120% of the first month's rent depending upon the agreement but no one can never charge you more because you've used our services so you would never see any additional fees or increase different rates anything like that related to working with A Place for Mom so do you understand that our services are free to you 
yes I do
