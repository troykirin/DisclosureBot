when you confirm your name is Sarah Kershaw is that correct yes okay so in addition to confirming your name I need a record that I provided you with these disclosures and I need for you to sign it but instead of physically signing something we can actually have you sign over the phone right now by recording this conversation that alright yeah okay so just to let you know again our service is free to you because we are paid a referral fee by our partner communities only if we help you find a good fit and you decide to move your dad in that referral fee that the communities paid to us ranges from 78% to 120% of the first month's rent depending upon the agreement but no one can ever charge you more your dad more because you've used our services so you would never see any additional fees or increase to rent rates anything like that in relation to working with A Place for Mom so do you understand our services are free to you 
 yes
